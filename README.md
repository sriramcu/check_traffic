# check_traffic
Check the traffic on your GitHub repositories, in terms of views and clones.  

Have you ever wanted to check the traffic on ALL your repositiories, but were too lazy to click on insights after manually navigating to all your repos? Well, now I've written a program that will open the traffic graphs for all your repos simulataneously, saving you the hassle of clicking a million times. All you have to do is run the program.  

## Steps:
1. Set up python on your Linux.  

2. Clone this repo:  
`git clone https://github.com/sriramcu/check_traffic/`
`cd check_traffic/`  

3. Edit the file username.txt to enter your git username.  

4. Run the program. Note that only public repos will be opened.  
`python3 check_traffic.py`  

5. Profit!
